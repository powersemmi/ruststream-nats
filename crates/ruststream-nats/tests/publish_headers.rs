//! What carrying a header map through a publish costs.
//!
//! The publisher is handed the map the transforms filled, and the only copy of it a publish may
//! make is the one the published log keeps. Address equality cannot say whether a map was moved
//! or copied - its values are `Bytes`, which keep their data pointer across a clone - so the
//! measurement is this thread's allocation count around one publish.
