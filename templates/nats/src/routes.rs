//! Wiring: collect the `orders` handlers into one `Router`, mounted by `main` via `include_router`.
//!
//! Keeping registration in its own module lets the handlers stay broker-agnostic - the router binds
//! to a concrete broker only when `main` mounts it.

/// Builds the orders router: a publishing handler (replies to `confirmations`) plus a plain one.
///
/// `confirm` needs a publisher for its reply; `TypedPublisher::new` pairs the Core NATS publish
/// policy with the default codec, reused to decode the order. The policy holds no connection, so
/// the router is built long before anything connects and the runtime pairs it at startup.
/// `on_cancel` has no reply, so it is mounted with `include` (also the default codec). The router
/// is a consuming builder, so the calls chain; the registration list is opaque, hence
/// `impl RouterDef`.
